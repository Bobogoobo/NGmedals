See the [news post](https://bobogoobo.newgrounds.com/news/post/832879) up on Newgrounds.

This project was originally made in 2013 and updated occasionally whenever I found out it wasn't working. It's been a while so I decided to give it a home here.
I'm sure I would create this very differently if I redid it today, but why not use what works.

Instructions are provided in the news post above and through the console as the program runs. (Version checking still done through the news post, until I bother to change it later.)

Legal: it's mine, don't steal it, and credit me for any usage of code. No need to credit for personal use but feel free to link back to the repo.

Not taking contributions.

I currently maintain the [top medal users list](http://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/1042325/99999) - program created by DiMono.
